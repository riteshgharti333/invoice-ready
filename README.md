## 🤖 AI Invoice Assistant

Invoice Ready includes a **Groq-powered natural-language invoice assistant** that allows users to create invoices conversationally.

For example:

```text
Create an invoice for John for 3 website development services
at ₹15,000 each with 18% GST, due in 15 days.
```

The AI workflow can extract and process:

* Customer information
* Services
* Quantities
* Prices
* Discounts
* Taxes
* Due dates
* Notes
* Invoice modifications

### AI Architecture

The AI pipeline includes:

* Natural-language intent classification
* Customer/service matching
* Conversational context
* Structured JSON extraction
* Schema validation
* Response repair
* Warning generation
* Request timeouts
* Transient-error retries
* Exponential backoff
* Input-length protection

Local deterministic intent classification is used for greetings, vague requests, gibberish, and unrelated prompts before invoking the LLM, helping avoid unnecessary model requests.

---

## 📧 Email & WhatsApp Automation

Invoice Ready can automatically communicate invoice events to customers.

### Email

Powered by **Nodemailer + SMTP**.

Supports:

* Invoice PDF delivery
* Due-date reminders
* Overdue notifications
* Reusable HTML email templates

### WhatsApp

Integrated with the **WhatsApp Graph API** for:

* Invoice due reminders
* Overdue invoice notifications
* Remaining balance information
* Phone-number normalization

---

## ⏰ Automated Notifications

A scheduled notification service processes billing events automatically.

Daily jobs handle:

* Invoices due in 2 days
* Invoices due tomorrow
* Invoices due today
* Overdue invoices
* Expiring quotations

Notification delivery uses persisted sent-state tracking and duplicate checks to provide **idempotent notification behavior**.

---

## 📑 PDF Generation

Invoices and quotations are dynamically generated as A4 PDFs using **PDFKit**.

Generated documents include:

* Business information
* Customer information
* Invoice/quotation metadata
* Status and dates
* Item tables
* Quantities
* Discounts
* Taxes
* Totals
* Payment balances

Generated PDFs are cached in memory for **30 minutes** to avoid unnecessary repeated rendering.

---

## 📊 Dashboard & Analytics

The dashboard provides financial and operational insights including:

* Total revenue
* Outstanding balances
* Overdue invoices
* Invoice volume
* Quotation volume
* Monthly revenue
* Payment methods
* Invoice status distribution
* Service demand
* Recent invoices

Charts and visualizations are implemented using **ApexCharts**, with animated dashboard components powered by **Framer Motion**.

---

## 🔐 Authentication & Security

Invoice Ready implements multiple layers of application security.

### Authentication

* JWT authentication
* Bcrypt password hashing
* HTTP-only cookie support
* Bearer-token fallback
* Session restoration
* Role-aware authentication state

### Authorization

Role-based authorization middleware supports:

* Admin
* User

### API Security

* Helmet security headers
* CORS configuration
* Rate limiting
* Request validation
* Centralized error handling
* Request IDs
* Structured logging
* Environment validation
* Standardized API responses

JWT configuration also requires a sufficiently strong secret.

---

## ✅ Type-Safe Validation

Frontend and backend share Zod schemas through the shared package.

Validation covers:

* Authentication
* Customers
* Services
* Invoices
* Quotations
* Payments
* Status transitions
* Numeric ranges
* Field length limits

This keeps request contracts consistent across the application.

---
